I am currently a PhD Student at Temple University in the Computer and Information Science Department.
I am currently a part of the ASCENT research group at Temple University that is funded by the NSF’s Future of Work Initiative. Our group’s research focuses on using AI systems to assist neurodiverse individuals in finding and maintaining competitive employment. My contributions have included projects involving literature review, inclusive interface design, data mining and natural language processing.

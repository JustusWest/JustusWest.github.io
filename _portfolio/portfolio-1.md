title: "CampusGANDR: Social Comparisons Made Grander"
excerpt: "The CampusGANDR mobile application is being developed for the HeadsUp! Lab in the Psychology department. The purpose of the application is to provide Personalized Normative Feedback (PNF) regarding risky drinking behavior, in a gamified format. The game will provide college students the facts when it comes to college stereotypes/norms. These results will be presented in a game like fashion so users can learn along with fellow classmates, discover more aspects of campus life and interact with their peers in a friendly environment.<br/><img src='/images/CampusGANDR.jpg'>"
